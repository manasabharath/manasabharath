__One-way data binding__<br/>
One-way data binding is a one-way interaction between component and its template. If you perform any changes in your component, then it will reflect the HTML elements. It supports the following types âˆ’

String interpolation
In general, String interpolation is the process of formatting or manipulating strings. In Angular, Interpolation is used to display data from component to view (DOM). It is denoted by the expression of {{ }} and also known as mustache syntax.


__Event binding__<br/>
Events are actions like mouse click, double click, hover or any keyboard and mouse actions. If a user interacts with an application and performs some actions, then event will be raised. It is denoted by either parenthesis () or on-. We have different ways to bind an event to DOM element.

__Two-way data binding__ is a two-way interaction, data flows in both ways (from component to views and views to component). Simple example is ngModel. If you do any changes in your property (or model) then, it reflects in your view and vice versa. It is the combination of property and event binding.

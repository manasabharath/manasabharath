**Validation is important part of any web application. User's input must always be validated before sending across different layers of the application.**<br/><br/>
Validation is of two types<br/>
1.Client Side<br/>
2.Serve Side<br/>
Client side validation is good but we have to be dependent on browser and scripting language support.Client side validation is considered convenient for users as they get instant feedback. The main advantage is that it prevents a page from being postback to the server until the client validation is executed successfully.
For client script .NET used JavaScript. <br/>

**There are six types of validation controls in ASP.NET**<br/>
1.RequiredFieldValidation Control<br/>
2.CompareValidator Control<br/>
3.RangeValidator Control<br/>
4.RegularExpressionValidator Control<br/>
5.CustomValidator Control<br/>
6.ValidationSummary<br/>

**Validation Control	Description**<br/><br/>
**RequiredFieldValidation**	: Makes an input control a required field.<br/>
**CompareValidator**	:Compares the value of one input control to the value of another input control or to a fixed value<br/>
**RangeValidator**	:Checks that the user enters a value that falls between two values<br/>
**RegularExpressionValidator**	:Ensures that the value of an input control matches a specified pattern<br/>
**CustomValidator**	:Allows you to write a method to handle the validation of the value entered<br/>
**ValidationSummary**	:Displays a report of all validation errors occurred in a Web page<br/><br/>

**ASP.NET allows the users to create controls. These user defined controls are categorized into:**<br/>
1.User controls<br/>
2.Custom controls<br/><br/>

In ASP.Net, it is possible to create re-usable code. The re-usable code can be used in many places without having the need to write the code again.<br/>

The re-usable code helps in reducing the amount of time spent by the developer after writing the code. It can be done once and reused at multiple places.ASP.Net has the ability to create Web controls. These controls contain code which can be re-used. It can be used across application as per the requirement.<br/>

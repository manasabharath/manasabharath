## Difference between ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET MVC 

* __Single aligned web stack for ASP.NET Core MVC and Web APIs__<br/>
ASP.NET MVC 5 will allow us to choose MVC or Web API or both while creating a web application. It was because the web stack for MVC 5 and Web API are different. ASP.NET Core 5 now has a single-aligned web stack for MVC and Web API.

*  __Project (Solution) Structure Changes__<br/>
  ASP.NET Core 5 MVC solution explorer on the right-hand side, there is no Web.config, Global.asax. In asp.net Core appsettings.json, custom configuration files  deals with configuration settings, authentication and application start specific code execution.

* __Cross Platform Supporrts__<br/>
 ASP.Net Core is a cross-platform framework. So, using this framework we can develop any applications for any operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS etc. using Visual Studio Code, or any other code editors like Vim, Atom, Sublime.We can use this framework for developing web applications, console application or desktop applications which can be deployed in any operating systems. Also, this framework Cloud environment for development and deployments.
 
 * __ASP.NET Core apps donâ€™t need IIS for hosting__<br/>
  Asp.Net Core is a Cross-Platform framework, so we can host Asp.Net Core applications not only in IIS but also it can be hosted in the Nginx, Apache, Docker etc. Kestrel will be an internal web server for request processing.

* __Server Side and Client Side Dependency__<br/>
 In Core we are  working in Visual Studio IDE and deploy ASP.NET Core applications either on Windows, Linux, or Mac using .NET Core, its Server side management of dependencies.
 Client-side dependency management is more important because the client-side has more different packages from the server-side. Client-side will indeed have jQuery, Bootstrap, grunt, and any Javascript frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone, images, and style files.

 * __Inbuilt Dependency Injection (DI) support for ASP.NET Core 5__<br/>
  In ASP.NET MVC 5/4 or classic ASPX based applications, we use separate DI containers like Unity, AutoFac, StructureMap, etc. We had to build up our project to use DI, its additional effort.

Now in ASP.NET Core applications, dependency injection is inbuilt, i.e., no setup headache for DI. Just create some services and get ready to use DI.

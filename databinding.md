# Data Binding<br/>
* Its is a mechanism that provides a simple and easy way to display and interact with data.
* Allows the flow of data between ui elements and data object on user interface.
* Data binding, in the context of .NET, is the method by which controls on a user interface (UI) of a client application are configured to fetch from, or update data into, a data source, such as a database or XML document.
* Data binding forms the link to synchronize data between the data provider (data source) and the data consumer (UI displaying data), enabling two-way connection between visual elements and the data source.
